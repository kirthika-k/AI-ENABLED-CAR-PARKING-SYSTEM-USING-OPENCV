# AI-ENABLED-CAR-PARKING-SYSTEM-USING-OPENCV
The AI-enabled car parking system is designed to automate theprocessof parking a car in a parking lot using computer vision techniques. 
The system leverages the power of OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, todetect and analyse parking spaces, and guide the driver in finding anavailableparking spot. By incorporating AI algorithms,
the systemcan provide real-timeinformation about parking availability, reduce human error, and enhanceoverallparking efficiency.
